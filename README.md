## 🗂️ Projects Included

### 🎯 Real-Time Road Pothole Detection (YOLOv8m + TensorRT + Flask)
Developed a real-time computer vision system to detect potholes from live and uploaded road videos - optimized for GPU inference using TensorRT and CUDA for deployment in automotive safety and smart road monitoring.

### 🛠 IT Helpdesk Agent   
End-to-end agentic AI system built with PyTorch, LangChain, and LangGraph to classify IT tickets, retrieve evidence, plan fixes with Ollama/GPT, and execute only safe commands after judge verification.

### 🩺 Medical Chatbot (RAG + GPT-3.5)
AI-powered chatbot that answers health-related queries by retrieving answers from CDC and WHO documents using FAISS VectorStore. Falls back to GPT-3.5 when context is missing.

### 🏠 House Price Predictor
XGBoost regression model predicting house prices based on real-world housing features. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and RMSE evaluation.

### 📉 Customer_Churn_Prediction
Logistic regression model to predict telecom customer churn using demographic and usage data. Includes EDA, feature encoding, model evaluation, and accuracy metrics.

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis
Streamlit-based app that classifies movie reviews into sentiment categories using a fine-tuned BERT model. Built with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

### 📈 NVIDIA Stock Analysis
Time-series and volatility modeling on NVIDIA stock using ARIMA, LSTM, and GARCH to uncover seasonality, predict trends, and assess risk.

### ☁️ CityWeather
A web app that fetches and displays real-time weather data using API integrations — built with a focus on clean UI and API handling.

### 💉 Covid19_Vaccination_Analysis_in_SQL
Performed SQL-based analysis on COVID-19 vaccination datasets to extract insights and trends from global vaccination campaigns.

### 🌿 PowerBI_Plant_Co
Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize operational and sales metrics of a fictional plant company for actionable business insights.

### 🧮 Scientific Calculator using Python
A GUI-based calculator developed using Tkinter in Python — handles both basic and scientific operations.

### 📊 Google Data Analytics Capstone - Cyclistic Case Study
A complete end-to-end case study applying the Google Data Analytics Certificate methodology — analyzed bike-share data to provide strategic recommendations.

### 💰 Cryptotracker
Built a cryptocurrency price tracker that pulls real-time data from APIs to monitor current prices, market caps, and trends.
