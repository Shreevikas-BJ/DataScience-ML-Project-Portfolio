🚀 My Project Portfolio

Welcome! 
This repository is a collection of diverse projects I've worked on with **genuine passion**, **a hunger to explore**, and **a deep willingness to learn**.

Each folder here reflects a part of my journey - building intelligent systems, optimizing deep learning models for real-time performance, and solving real-world problems through AI, machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics.



-> Projects Included

1. Real-Time Road Pothole Detection (YOLOv8m + TensorRT + Flask)
    Developed a real-time computer vision system to detect potholes from live and uploaded road videos - optimized for GPU inference using TensorRT and CUDA for deployment in automotive safety and smart road monitoring.

2. IT Helpdesk Agent   
    End-to-end agentic AI system built with PyTorch, LangChain, and LangGraph to classify IT tickets, retrieve evidence, plan fixes with Ollama/GPT, and execute only safe commands after judge verification.

3. Medical Chatbot (RAG + GPT-3.5)
    AI-powered chatbot that answers health-related queries by retrieving answers from CDC and WHO documents using FAISS VectorStore. Falls back to GPT-3.5 when context is missing.

4. House Price Predictor
    XGBoost regression model predicting house prices based on real-world housing features. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and RMSE evaluation.

5. Customer_Churn_Prediction
    Logistic regression model to predict telecom customer churn using demographic and usage data. Includes EDA, feature encoding, model evaluation, and accuracy metrics.

6. Sentiment Analysis
    Streamlit-based app that classifies movie reviews into sentiment categories using a fine-tuned BERT model. Built with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.

7. NVIDIA Stock Analysis
    Time-series and volatility modeling on NVIDIA stock using ARIMA, LSTM, and GARCH to uncover seasonality, predict trends, and assess risk.

8. Covid19_Vaccination_Analysis_in_SQL
    Performed SQL-based analysis on COVID-19 vaccination datasets to extract insights and trends from global vaccination campaigns.
