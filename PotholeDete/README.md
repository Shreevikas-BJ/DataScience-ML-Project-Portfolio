# Road Pothole Detection Dashboard (YOLOv8 + TensorRT + Flask)

This project performs real-time pothole detection from uploaded or live road videos using a YOLOv8 model optimized with NVIDIA TensorRT for GPU inference. The Flask dashboard allows users to upload a video, visualize detections, and monitor confidence/FPS live.
